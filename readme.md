# Notice: This package is discontinued

Oh wow, absolutely awesome. If Mailchannels thinks that after they just dropped the integration with cloudflare I will sign up for their services again - hell nah bro. They didn't make it a paid service through cloudflare dashboard, no. They just nuked it altogether, breaking existing applications. And keep in mind that there was no warning email or "occasional error messages" as they claimed in their cowardly posted blog post. Lessons learned? I will never use Mailchannels ever again. I could not care less about the internal cooking between two companies but if you create a feature/product that people rely on - be so kind and at least warn us using a proper communication channel and not a damn blog post.
